# Precise_gravity_simulation

This work was carried out in collaboration with Ilian Lamrani Auffray and Margot Aubusson de Cavarlay, under the supervision of Benjamin Bogosel (CMAP - École Polytechnique).

We compare Runge–Kutta methods of various orders with adaptive steps, first on a simple pendulum and then in a gravitational field. The objective is to find the fastest trajectory to reach an objective point, given a configuration with fixed bodies (planets) and a starting point.

We then extended the work to simulate three-body systems.
